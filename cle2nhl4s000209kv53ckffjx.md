# Sharing is growing, Keeping is stagnating

Making yourself indispensable in a company is a great way to ensure job security and career growth. But, if you’re not careful, you could end up going down the wrong path.

Manual tasks can be incredibly tedious, time-consuming and unrewarding. The entire process can be incredibly complex and require a lot of interaction. It’s this very complexity that can sometimes stop people from attempting a task, or make someone tackling them a hero.

The tools I created allowed me to be seen as a problem solver and a situation saver. I could quickly and easily help people with their problems and get them out of a bind that they couldn't have gotten out of without my help. I was able to be the hero without anyone knowing what I was doing. It was like a superpower that only I knew about.

Creating tools and process that only you know how to use, what they do, and why they do it, may seem like a great way to bolster your position in the company. After all, you’re the only person who knows how to use them and you’re the only person who knows what they do and why they do it.

But, while this might make you feel secure, it’s not the best way to make yourself shine. If you’re the only one who can use the tools, then you become a blocker.

You become so focused on growing and protecting your secrets that you're locked into a cycle of keeping your secrets and hoping that new use cases will emerge.

You're also missing out on the potential benefits of collaboration. When you collaborate with others, you can learn from their experiences and create even more powerful solutions. This is especially true when it comes to problem-solving, as collaboration can help you brainstorm potential solutions more quickly and efficiently.

When you take that step to share what you have created, it allows for more engagement and input from your peers, thus validating your efforts. This kind of openness also allows more people to provide their critiques and suggestions, pushing you to further refine your solutions.

Then, you are no longer simply focused on your secret projects, but also on how to make your work more global in scope, both in terms of distribution and advertising. This is a tremendous opportunity for improvement and development, enabling you to put your skills and knowledge to even better use.

Moreover, with this kind of openness comes a sense of true recognition and appreciation. When others can see and experience the results of your hard work, rather than praising you through some sort of magical framework, it becomes that much more rewarding–and motivating. When people are exposed to and understand the fruits of your labor, they can more aptly appreciate it, and that elevates your necessary sense of validation.

All in all, the benefits that come from having increased transparency in your work are invaluable. By opening up your efforts to your colleagues, you are guaranteed to receive the kind of knowledge and feedback that will take your projects to the next level.

Now that you’ve revealed your secrets and taken an honest look at yourself and your skills, you’re likely to find that you’re viewed more positively and you’re likely to receive the recognition and appreciation you deserve from your colleagues and company.

Gone are the days of relying on secret tools and old-fashioned methods to get work done, as people are instead recognizing your skills and your efforts as valuable assets to their team.

You have shown your colleagues and company that you are not merely a tool – you are a source of knowledge and a problem-solver. People will perceive you as someone who is valued for the skills they bring to the table, and not just a “secret tool”.

That kind of respect can only be earned, not given.

As someone who reveals their secrets and shares their knowledge freely, you will be identified as a team-oriented person, which is invaluable in the workplace. Your newfound power will offer you great opportunities!

You have not just shown others that you are capable and confident, but trustworthy and capable of much more. Trust is the foundation of any successful business, and revealing your business secrets is a great way to build that trust with colleagues and employers.

You have the power to create a positive work environment and contribute to the success of the company with your knowledge and problem-solving skills.
